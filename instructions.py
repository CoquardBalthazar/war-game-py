    W E L C O M E  T O  W A R !

    The rules are simple, play a card and pray to god that it is a 
    higher rank than your opponents card.

    If you play the same card rank as your opponent, it's WAR !
    You and your opponent will play 5 more cards, only the last one
    needs to be higher rank than your opponents second card.
    If it is, you get all the cards played that round.

    If the computer cannot play, you win !

    LET'S BEGIN ! """)
